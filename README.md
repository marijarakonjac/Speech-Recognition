# Speech Recognition Project

This repository contains the code and report for a project completed as part of the Speech Recognition course. The project focuses on various aspects of speech signal processing, including segmentation, pitch period estimation, and speech recognition using Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main tasks:

1. **Speech Signal Segmentation and Pitch Period Estimation**:
   - Recording a speech sequence using MATLAB.
   - Segmenting the speech signal using short-time energy and zero-crossing rate.
   - Estimating the pitch period using parallel processing and autocorrelation methods.

2. **Speech Signal Quantization**:
   - Implementing Âµ-law companding quantizers with different bit resolutions.
   - Designing a Delta quantizer and analyzing its performance.

3. **Speech Recognition**:
   - Building a database of spoken digits.
   - Implementing preprocessing and feature extraction using LPC coefficients.
   - Classifying spoken digits using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
